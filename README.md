## Introduction

- TLDR:
  - Bash scripts to transfer attachment and avatar files from MongoDB GridFS to Minio file server, using below CLI commands.
- Why:
  - To make MongoDB Server database size smaller (like from 800 GB to 10 GB), store files elsewhere, and have files visible in upcoming version of WeKan.
  - It is very slow to backup 800 GB database, using mongodump to backup could take many days.
  - This separate file transfer tool is required, because using WeKan built-in migrations still has too many time consuming step.
  - Meteor WeKan will continue using MongoDB for text data. Files can be stored outside of MongoDB.
  - Upcoming Multiverse WeKan https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/4578 will use SQLite database for text data. Files are stored outside of SQLite.

## Requirements

Installed commands:

- mc: minio mc command https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html
- mongofiles and mongoexport: newest from MongoDB tools https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools
- sqlite3: For example, `sudo apt install sqlite3`
- Bash shell, like Linux or WSL.

## Transferring files

1. Edit `settings.sh` to change MongoDB, SQLite and Minio settings.

2. a) Do everything of 2b) at one step

 `./start.sh`

2. b) Do in separate steps

`./mongoexport.sh` (Copy text from MongoDB to SQLite)

`./transfer.sh` (Copy files from MongoDB to Minio)

Logging transfer to textfile:

`./transfer.sh > logfile.txt`

Looking at transfer progress at other terminal:

`tail -f logfile.txt`

mc command has command line option to add metadata

Metadata can be added be selected from SQLite database in transfer.sh script.

Metadata needs to need in JSON format properly.

mc command also has SQL to search.

How to remove extra text when looking logfile, not needed working results:
```
cat logfile.txt | grep -v success | less
```
- That -v option removes that kind of text from logfile, only showing errors or other remaining text.
- In remaining log text can be seen, is there any file transfer errors, or does some file need to be transferred again.
- To be tested, does exporting newer attachments require different OID1 etc format.

## What will happen while tranferring files

1. Export MongoDB text to wekan.db (Temporary .csv files at directory csv will be deleted after they have been imported to SQLite)

2. Export file from MongoDB GridFS to current directory

3. Upload file to Minio

4. Delete file from current directory, to not fill more disk space.

5. Go back to step 2. for each file

NOTE: Running scripts again currently will overwrite wekan.db file new data and transfer files to minio again.


## TODO

- Current bugs:
  - When transferring files, some of files are not transferred. Is this bug in mc command, bash script, or MinIO server?
  - When metadata is added, some metadata is missing for some files.
  - Does MinIO not work on ext4 on Linux? https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/16602#issuecomment-1427509203
  - This MinIO bug is problem, someone recommended to not use MinIO because of it https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/9419
  - Would MinIO server AGPLv3 license change WeKan MIT licence to AGPLv3 ? Some recommend staying away from MinIO: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35328316
  - What alternatives there are for MinIO ?
  - Attachment filename sanitize when storing files serverside, like use only ObjectID or hash https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/4416
- Add more metadata to minio.
  - Create SQL query for FILEID
  - For each FILEID, do queries for metadata, like cardname, username, etc
  - Combine metadata to correct JSON file format that is OK to save to minio
