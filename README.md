## Requirements

Installed commands:

- mc: minio mc command https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html
- mongofiles and mongoexport: newest from MongoDB tools https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools
- sqlite3: For example, `sudo apt install sqlite3`

## Transferring files

1. Edit settings.sh

2. `./start.sh`

## What will happen while tranferring files

This will:

1. Export MongoDB text to wekan.sqlite (Temporary .csv files at directory csv/ )

2. Export file from MongoDB GridFS to current directory

3. Upload file to Minio

4. Delete file from current directory, to not fill more disk space.

5. Go back to step 2. for each file

## TODO

- Add metadata to minio. All that metadata is also at wekan.sqlite, so it could be also added later.
