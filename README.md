# Transfer files from MongoDB GridFS to Minio file server, and MongoDB text to SQLite

## Introduction

- TLDR:
  - Bash scripts to transfer attachment and avatar files from MongoDB GridFS to Minio file server, using below CLI commands.
- Why:
  - To make MongoDB Server database size smaller (like from 800 GB to 10 GB), store files elsewhere, and have files visible in upcoming version of WeKan.
  - It is very slow to backup 800 GB database, using mongodump to backup could take many days.
  - This separate file transfer tool is required, because using WeKan built-in migrations still has too many time consuming step.
  - Meteor WeKan will continue using MongoDB for text data. Files can be stored outside of MongoDB.
  - Upcoming Multiverse WeKan https://github.com/wekan/wekan/issues/4578 will use SQLite database for text data. Files are stored outside of SQLite.

## Requirements

Installed commands:

- mc: minio mc command https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html
- mongofiles and mongoexport: newest from MongoDB tools https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools
- sqlite3: For example, `sudo apt install sqlite3`
- Bash shell, like Linux or WSL.

## Transferring files

1. Edit `settings.sh` to change MongoDB, SQLite and Minio settings.

2. a) Do everything of 2b) at one step

 `./start.sh`

2. b) Do in separate steps

`./mongoexport.sh` (Copy text from MongoDB to SQLite)

`./transfer.sh` (Copy files from MongoDB to Minio)

## What will happen while tranferring files

1. Export MongoDB text to wekan.sqlite (Temporary .csv files at directory csv will be deleted after they have been imported to SQLite)

2. Export file from MongoDB GridFS to current directory

3. Upload file to Minio

4. Delete file from current directory, to not fill more disk space.

5. Go back to step 2. for each file

NOTE: Running scripts again currently will overwrite wekan.sqlite file new data and transfer files to minio again.

## TODO

- Add metadata to minio. All that metadata is also at wekan.sqlite, so it could be also added later.
- After uploading file to MinIO, check that it was uploaded successfully, that uploading did not fail.
- Continue from interrupted transfer process file number.
